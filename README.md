# Stony Ridge Observatory (SRO)

SRO was originally designed and built, and continues to be owned and operated by amateur astronomers. This observatory has served its members, science investigators, students and the public (through planned outreach programs) since its completion in 1963.  When completed in 1963, Stony Ridge's 30-inch telescope was the eighth-largest telescope in California, and most likely the largest amateur telescope in the world.

Our observatory is a 45-minute drive along the Angeles Crest Highway north of Pasadena, California.   It is perched on a ridge above the 2000-foot deep Devil's Canyon, about 6 miles (9.7 km) north by north-east of the historic Mt. Wilson Observatory. Stony Ridge is located very near the "Horse Flats" sie that had been considered for the location of George Ellery Hale's "new" 200-inch (5-m) telescope.

The primary instrument at SRO is a fork-mounted, 30-inch (0.76-m) Newtonian-Cassegrain reflector designed for multiple focal ratios of f/6 (Newtonian focus) and f/25 (Cassegrain focus). This superb instrument was designed and built by George A. Carroll with considerable help from the members of Stony Ridge Observatory. The main telescope tube has two refractor telescopes mounted to it, a 5-inch (12.5 cm) f/5, and a 6-inch (15.2 cm) f/15 telescope. These instruments, including the optical glass lens elements, were both designed and built by George Carroll.

The Station Fire nearly destroyed the observatory in the summer of 2009, has taken many years to bring the observatory up to full working condition in 2018.   We had many exciting plans for outreach and observing campaigns for 2020, but a mudslide on the Angeles Crest highway in 2019 amd the global pandemic in 2020 has put those plans on hold.   We are currently working on setting up video streaming from the telescope for outreach programs.  When we get it working, we'll put information on this page.

## Visiting

Stony Ridge Observatory is not opened to the general public. However, we will have public outreach events when it is safe again to do so.   To be notified of these vents, or for other queries, please email [outreach@sro.groups.io](mailto:outreach@sro.groups.io).

## Membership

Stony Ridge Observatory is a non-profit 501(c)3 corperation run by volunteers.   If you are interested in joining, contact [outreach@sro.groups.io](mailto:outreach@sro.groups.io).  Potential mmebers submit an application to the SRO Board of Directors. Upon acceptance of your returned application by the Board of Directors, you will be invited to become an Associate Member of Stony Ridge Observatory for a period of not longer than two (2) years.

During this period, if you desire to use the site and equipment without supervision, you must successfully complete a qualification period on the use and safety of the equipment and site. This usually takes 4 or 5 on-site training sessions afterwhich you will be given full access to the observatory and telescope. Time on the telescope is subscribed on a first-come, first-served basis. During your Associate 2-year period, your annual dues will be $250. At any time during your Associate status, you may petition the Board of Directors for full membership.  Full membership cost is $3000, minus any amount paid during your Associate membership. This sum may be paid in full at the end of Associate status, or in 3 yearly, equal amounts.  Full members pay dues of $150 to use the telescope and have voting rights and the opportunity to be elected as an Officer or member of the Board.
