# Stony Ridge Observatory (SRO)

SRO was originally designed and built, and continues to be owned and operated by amateur astronomers. This observatory has served its members, science investigators, students and the public (through planned outreach programs) since its completion in 1963.

Our observatory is perched on a ridge above the 2000-foot deep Devil's Canyon, about 6 miles (9.7 km) north by north-east of the historic Mt. Wilson Observatory. Stony Ridge is located very near a site that had been considered for the location of George Ellery Hale's "new" 200-inch (5-m) telescope. That location was at "Horse Flats" described in this 1928 paper.

After a 45-minute drive along the Angeles Crest Highway north of Pasadena, California, the visitor arrives at Stony Ridge Observatory in the heart of the beautiful Angeles National Forest.
